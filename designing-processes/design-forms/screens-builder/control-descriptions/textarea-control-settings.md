# Textarea Control Settings

## Control Description

Though this control displays a vertical scroll bar if more than three lines are inserted, the input box can be expanded as necessary. To do this, click the lower right-hand corner of the input box of the Textarea control, hold, and then drag to enlarge or shrink the control size as necessary. Release when you have adjusted the input box to your required size.

{% hint style="info" %}
This control is not available for [Display](../types-for-screens.md#display)-type ProcessMaker Screens. See [Screen Types](../types-for-screens.md).
{% endhint %}

2. View the ProcessMaker Screen page to which to add the control.
3. Go to the **Controls** panel on the left side of the ProcessMaker Screen.

Drag the **Textarea** icon![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/textarea-control-screens-builder-processes.png)from the **Controls** panel anywhere within the ProcessMaker Screen canvas represented by the dotted-lined box. Existing controls on the ProcessMaker Screen canvas adjust positioning based on where you drag the control.
5. Drop into the ProcessMaker Screen where you want the control to display on the page.
