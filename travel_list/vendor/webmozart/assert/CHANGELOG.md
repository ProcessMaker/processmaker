Changelog
=========

## UNRELEASED

## 1.7.0 (2020-02-14)

### Added

* added `Assert::notFalse()`
* added `Assert::isAOf()`
* added `Assert::isAnyOf()`
* added `Assert::isNotA()`

## 1.6.0 (2019-11-24)

### Added

* added `Assert::validArrayKey()`
* added `Assert::isNonEmptyList()`
* added `Assert::isNonEmptyMap()`
* added `@throws InvalidArgumentException` annotations to all methods that throw.
* added `@psalm-assert` for the list type to the `isList` assertion.

### Fixed

* `ResourceBundle` & `SimpleXMLElement` now pass the `isCountable` assertions.
They are countable, without implementing the `Countable` interface.
* The doc block of `range` now has the proper variables.
* An empty array will now pass `isList` and `isMap`. As it is a valid form of both.
If a non empty variant is needed, use `isNonEmptyList` or `isNonEmptyMap`.

### Changed

* Removed some `@psalm-assert` annotations, that were 'side effect' assertions See:
  * [#144](https://github.com/webmozart/assert/pull/144)
  * [#145](https://github.com/webmozart/assert/issues/145)
  * [#146](https://github.com/webmozart/assert/pull/146)
  * [#150](https://github.com/webmozart/assert/pull/150)
* If you use psalm, the minimum version needed is `3.6.0`. Which is enforced through a composer conflict.
If you don't use psalm, then this has no impact.

## 1.5.0 (2019-08-24)

### Added

* added `Assert::uniqueValues()`
* added `Assert::unicodeLetters()`
* added: `Assert::email()`
* added support for [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm), by adding `@psalm-assert` annotations where appropriate.

### Fixed

* `Assert::endsWith()` would not give the correct result when dealing with multibyte suffix.
* `Assert::length(), minLength, maxLength, lengthBetween` would not give the correct result when dealing with multibyte characters.

**NOTE**: These 2 changes may break your assertions if you relied on the fact that multibyte characters didn't behave correctly.

### Changed

* The names of some variables have been updated to better reflect what they are.
* All function calls are now in their FQN form, slightly increasing performance.
* Tests are now properly ran against HHVM-3.30 and PHP nightly.

### Deprecation

* deprecated `Assert::isTraversable()` in favor of `Assert::isIterable()`
  * This was already done in 1.3.0, but it was only done through a silenced `trigger_error`. It is now annotated as well.
