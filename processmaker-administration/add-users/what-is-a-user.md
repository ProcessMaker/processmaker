# What is a User?

In ProcessMaker 4, a "user" is any person for which a ProcessMaker account is created to allow that individual to do the following:

* Log in to ProcessMaker using unique credentials.
* ProcessMaker Administrators can track the last time each ProcessMaker user logged in.
* Each ProcessMaker user can adjust his or her [user profile](../../using-processmaker/profile-settings.md).
* ProcessMaker Administrators can [activate or deactivate]() any ProcessMaker user's account.
