# What is Client Authentication?

## Overview

ProcessMaker requires ProcessMaker Developers who want to access the [ProcessMaker 4 REST API](https://develop-demo.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation) to follow OAuth 2.0 authentication protocols. OAuth 2.0 authentication is a published specification outside the scope of ProcessMaker. Refer to [OAuth.net](https://oauth.net/2/) to learn more about this specification.

Client authentication keys are required to access the [ProcessMaker 4 REST API](https://develop-demo.bpm4.qa.processmaker.net/api/documentation).
